# Creative Minds Portfolio

Welcome to the **Creative Minds Portfolio**! This project is a practice exercise for learning how to use Git and GitHub. The goal is to create a simple, creative portfolio website using GitHub Pages while exploring various Git features such as branches, commits, pull requests, and more.

## Project Overview

This project is designed to help creative individuals showcase their work by creating a personal portfolio website. The project focuses on using GitHub to manage the development and deployment of the website, allowing you to:

- Practice GitHub commands (`git clone`, `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`, etc.)
- Work with branches (`git branch`, `git checkout`, `git merge`)
- Create and review pull requests
- Deploy a static website using GitHub Pages

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/creative-minds-portfolio.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd creative-minds-portfolio
   ```

3. **Create a new branch** to work on a new feature:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature-new-section
   ```

4. **Add your changes** and commit:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Added new section to the portfolio"
   ```

5. **Push your changes** to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature-new-section
   ```

6. **Create a pull request** to merge your changes into the main branch via GitHub.
